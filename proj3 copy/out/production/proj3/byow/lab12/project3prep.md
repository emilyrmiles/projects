# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:
Mine was intended to be split top vs bottom whereas my gsi implemented it side to side, and started from bottom left whereas I started top left, which is a negligible difference.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:
the hexagon is the world and they contain hallways/rooms
analogy would be

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:
i would think to add a row helper at first or x and y helpers

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
they have diff widths
